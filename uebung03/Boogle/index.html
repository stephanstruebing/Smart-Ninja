            lets start with the boogle logo on top
            the IMG tag would fit well with a shiny id and the well known center-them class

            I guess we have two "H"eadlines ;)
            the center-them class didn't work? how could you center your text?

        <h1>One account. All of Google.</h1>

            the next part would fit in a CONTAINER, do you agree?
            a fancy background with a nice box-shadow would be amazing...

            <!--
                the IMG and the INPUTs shouldn't be any problem for you, with the right padding and border-radius everything is fine. Everything looks better with the right box-shadow ^^
